# Coffee Shop Message

This is a little [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function I've got hooked up to a [Flic button](https://flic.io) at [my work's](https://www.chromatix.com.au/) fave [coffee shop](https://www.instagram.com/tgfcollective/).

Like all good cafes they open early, and sometimes close early - particularly when they've sold out of salads, or it's a quiet afternoon. So the Flic sits on their wall, and when they're about to close they tap it... a few doors down our office gets a Slack message and we know to come get our last coffees of the day!
